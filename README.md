The write-up for this project is contained within the repo as a Word file. It is called 'YouTube vs Spotify - Coble Hartman'

The Google Slides presentation is also included in the repo. It is called 'Spotify Vs. YouTube'

There are three revisions to the main code, as this was a group project. So we pushed regularly to get back in sync. The main code is under the 'Final Project' notebook. That notebook includes each team member's code in their respective sections.
